All the 48 shavian letters on blue background are added, mimicking the Discord `:regional_indicator_x:` emojis. Images are named by their shavian letter name, for example `:regional_indicator_pip:`

`:regional_indicator_dot:` is the namer dot on a blue background.

`:bib:` is êëö on a red background, mimicking the discord `:b:` emoji.

In total this is 50 images, enough to fill a single Discord server emoji quota.

The generator can be modified to generate arbitrary unciode on blue/red background, just change the content of `letters` and `red_letters` - and you may need to change the font family in the `TEMPLATE` svg.

Generation as is relies on the [Inter Alia](https://github.com/Shavian-info/interalia) font, its license is copied here since this repo redistributes the pngs.
